# Automating Coursework Submission using JavaScript

# Overview
In this project, coursework reading, quizzes, and assignments submitted by students are tracked using AppScript.

It is important to note that this project aims to deliver coursework to students effectively in the Google Classroom
environment. All codes were run using the AppScript extension embedded in GCP.
